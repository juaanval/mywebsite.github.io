        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I was born on August 17, 2005, in Barcelona. I studied at home until the age of three when I entered Montserrat School in Barcelona, where I studied
             until I was 15. I moved to Madrid due to the political situation. In Madrid, I enrolled in CEU San Pablo School in Monteprincipe. Now, I attend 
             Francisco de Vitoria University. Among my hobbies is music. I have always liked music; since I was a child, I have collected CDs, and I have always 
             been drawn to old vinyl records. My favorite album is "LP!" by Peggy, an American rapper, singer, and record producer born in New York City and based 
             in Baltimore, Maryland. His 2018 album, "Veteran," received widespread critical acclaim and appeared on many year-end lists. It was followed by 
             "All My Heroes Are Cornballs" in 2019 and "LP!" in 2021, released to even greater critical acclaim. This album is groundbreaking with innovative sounds
              that captivate everyone who listens to it.

    <div class="box4"><p>Another of my interests is MMA; I practice kickboxing and jiu-jitsu. I didn't start getting interested in these until recently.
         I got into the world of MMA because I needed to exercise to control my ADHD, and I quickly fell in love with them. At first, like everyone, 
         it was difficult and very tiring to go, but now it has become part of my daily routine. </p></div>
