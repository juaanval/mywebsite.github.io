        <p>Bossa nova is a relaxed style of samba developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Rio de Janeiro, 
            Brazil. It is mainly characterized by a "different beat" that altered the harmonies with the introduction of unconventional chords and an 
            innovative syncopation of traditional samba from a single rhythmic division.</p>
